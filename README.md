### Employee - Salary Info

- This React project was created to allow users to enter and save employee names and salary information.
- For styling, I used Tailwind CSS.
- To manage the state, I used useState, and passed data using props.
- Additionally, implemented a modal structure for displaying errors in input forms.
- Used createPortal function for displaying error that allows me to render children.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
